# MOAD-FNet

Welcome to the official repository for **MOAD-FNet**, a multimodal dual-fusion framework that integrates DNA methylation data with whole slide images (WSIs) for precision oncology.  
This work is currently under **second review at IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI)**, and represents a step toward more interpretable and clinically relevant AI for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
